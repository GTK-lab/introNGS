Next generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly used to address a range of different questions including gene expression, copy number variations and transcription factor binding site. The analysis of NGS data is very bioinformatics intensive. Following sequencing, millions of short reads are produced. In and of themselves, it is impossible to make sense of the data. Hence, these reads have to be aligned against a reference genome prior to further analysis. This practical class will take you through the first few steps of NGS data analysis: quality control of reads, alignment and some basic manipulation using samtools.  
> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of NGS data analysis. It is assumed that
> you are at least comfortable working in the command line and are familiar with 
> some basic linux terminologies.
